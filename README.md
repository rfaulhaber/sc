# sc

A terminal-based stack calculator, written in Rust.

This project is a work in progress. 

## Installing

Currently you must manually build this project using `cargo`.

## Use

While the program is running, add numbers to the stack by typing a number and
hitting the Enter key. To perform an operation, enter a valid operator and
the program will pop the last two items off the stack, perform the operation,
print the result, and push the result to the stack.
